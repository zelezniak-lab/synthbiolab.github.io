In the Zelezniak lab, my focus is on applying generative AI methods to design DNA. I use techniques similar to those employed by ChatGPT, but instead of generating written text, I generate DNA sequences from transcripts, plasmids, and chromosomes. This technology has a wide range of applications, from optimizing protein production to creating DNA that expresses only in specific cell types.
