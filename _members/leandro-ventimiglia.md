Leandro Ventimiglia is a Research Fellow at the Randall Centre for Cell & Molecular Biophysics, Kingâ€™s College London, UK. His work focuses on identifying the genomic patterns determining the level of gene expression in different tissues and cell. He applies a combination of bioinformatics tools and machine learning methods to investigate the organization of mammalian cis-regulatory regions. His research aims to use generative models to create tuneable regulatory sequences capable of controlling the expression levels in different cell types.
