I work on non-conventional yeast within the Zelezniak Group. The focus of my work is to explore these yeasts and their potential as a more refined protein expression model than conventional cell factories. I will be employing the latest molecular tools, such as CRISPR-Cas, to develop an advanced library of NCY for the exploration of sustainable protein expression in yeast.
