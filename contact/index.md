We're excited to share our recent expansion to the Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics in London. Our roots are anchored in the Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, and we also have a satellite presence at Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre, Lithuania. Science does not have borders, and our collaborations are a testament to that.  We are always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and welcome your questions and comments.
